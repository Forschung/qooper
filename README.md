Deployed link: https://qooper.netlify.app

To run the application, please first go to the project folder and run:
```
npm run install
```
This command will install your node packages.

After installing the packages, you are ready to go. Just run this command and wohaa, you are in:
```
npm run dev
```

You can get an export build with following command:
```
npm run build && npm run export
```

And this will give you a /out folder on the root. You are now ready to deploy it anywhere.

The project typed mostly with TypeScript under React. You will love it believe me.

There are some extra commands which are already done for you. Just check the scripts section under package.json. You now have more options than you want which are designed professionally :)

And you can easily tie this app into your firebase app just by changing the related information inside the .env.local file.

This project completed for Qooper.IO review. But anyone can use it without too much effort. 

There are 4 customized components inside the project. Button, Input, Link, and Meta. You can find them under the components folder.

Lastly, you will find a Icons.xd file under the public/assets/favicon path. The file is designed for enterprise level applications icon integration. I love it too much and willing to share it as well.

Hope, you will enjoy using the great ToDo app :)
